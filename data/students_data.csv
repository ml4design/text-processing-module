"The long days behind your laptop were very tiring (but understandable). In addition, it would have been nice if more study places were available faster, so that no longer was only in your room every day. The education of course had to give way to the Corona crisis, but sometimes it was made very difficult. I would have liked it if there had been a choice during my studies whether you wanted to take your exam online or physically (since Q4 2020 everything has been physically in terms of exams). I sometimes found that you had to come physically unnecessary, since this also happened just before the Christmas holidays when everyone went to his parents afterwards. When you missed an exam by Corona, it was made fairly difficult to request an extra resit. This actually only encouraged students to come to the uni despite any complaints or quarantine. The same applies to Lab; It was said very clearly that when you missed a day by Corona or something, it was not possible to catch up and that you have to do it again next year. I thought this was incredibly weird and also irresponsible. She threatened with a year off if you just followed the Corona rules. This was very bothering me and I also noticed the stress of my fellow students that they were really not allowed to miss a day. This while some students live in large student houses with more than 18 people. The chance that you must then be in home quarantaine because one of these roommates has been (possibly) in contact with someone is simply quite high. So you are actually punished during the 4 weeks of this lab when you just follow the rules. I don't think your students are going to blame students for this, but it also entails the fellow students. In addition, it was also fairly annoying (also understandable) that the BEP period continues for at least 2 weeks during the holidays. In addition to these 2 weeks, most students also have further outlet. I thought it was fair that the BEP students were met in this, since, for example, the number of Lab Days of younger Years had been considerably reduced (not just lab). A lot of feedback, but of course I also realize that it was also very stressful for the professors and for university staff.

Normally I am going to do something out in the evening (groceries, exercise) so that I can sleep with Piece of Mind (nothing to do from the university, Fair Enough); - The week off after semester 1 was disastrous for my mental health and I became depressed/angry with boredom and stacked frustration. This was no longer fast enough to make a good start with Semester 2. Starting my own project can start, but I have to finish something like that before I can really focus on the study again and 1 week is just too short; - At the end of Semester 1, 4 exams were planned for me in 1 day. The teachers referred me to the study advisor. He referred me back to the teachers on somewhat bijdehante, while I had really clearly explained that I had referred by the teachers. In the end I was only able to make 2 of the 4 exams (so on the same day). - At a certain point in Q2, almost all lectures were on the same days (concentration is already difficult via the computer). Looking back worked very well through Virtual Classroom; - Collaborating with other students was sometimes difficult: not everyone adhered to agreements made or responded in time for deadlines and some did not really seem interested in the full depth of the assignments (sometimes this was very frustrating). - I think it is well -known that plagiarism and fraud are not tolerated.

"Having to study alone at home has caused most problems. First of all, I am someone who studies better outdoors, in a real study such as the library. There I can focus on my work, and I am surrounded by people and friends who are also studying and motivating me to continue working. I can also ask them for help if I get stuck and we can compare results. This helped me a lot in my bachelor at the TU. Because of COVID-19 I no longer have access to a similar environment and my productivity has fallen incredibly. I also know very few people on my master because I am a 1st year Master's student, and I only see my fellow students as names on my screen during college. So I hardly have anyone with whom assignments can discuss and with whom I can work together when I get stuck. This makes it considerably much more difficult to complete all deadlines in time. Finally, many lecturers have come up with that because of online education deadlines are a good idea to keep students involved in the lectures and the material. However, now I have so many deadlines (in Q2 on average 6 a week) that it is no longer possible to keep up with all my courses in terms of time and mentally, which means that I already have a delay without my reduced productivity. Also no direct contact with lecturers is difficult, because I have to look for a thesis supervisor in the future, and that would be a lot easier if I had already spoken my lecturers face-to-face.",,485,3,nee,6,masters jaar 1,luchtvaart- en ruimtevaarttechniek (lr)

I understand this reason but makes it a lot more difficult to plan meetings since everyone has a different schedule. So a lot of time sits down in finding out which day comes out for a meeting. Sometimes you don't have to follow courses as a result and look back later. This makes it more difficult to keep up and feels a bit inefficient.

"After doing everything online for more than a year, I really feel my motivation plummet. It is difficult if the same routine is sitting behind your desk every day and working until the day is over. If you go to the campus it feels very different. In addition, Professor student interaction is very low, and that is not directly due to the professors but more to the design. Personally, I find it difficult during DSE to find the balance. After doing DSE all day, you are just completely empty and you no longer have the motivation to do something useful, sometimes no more energy to do groceries or cook. This makes it difficult to eat healthily and also difficult to keep your room and yourself tidy and clean and that in turn ensures that you have even less motivation. It remains a kind of downward spiral and if it is really too bad, you do something again, but then it just starts again.

"The intense dichotomy that you are either a 'Mak Schaap', or a 'Coronawhappie'. Don't agree with certain policy actions is no longer an option. It ensures tacit dealing with other people, because when you open your mouth you run the risk of being put out. It has ensured that you will be paralyzed.
 I also had a lot of problems with extra Corona measures that come up with authorities that make no sense anymore. For example: on student associations you also have to keep 1.5 meters away from your housemates/relationship because the municipality of Delft has given up this extra rule to associations. Student associations generally have very strict rules while on a terrace or on a field in Hout, Delftse Hout, you have much more freedom.
 
 One of the biggest problems I have experienced is that your entire life moves to an online environment, and this is mentally too tiring to keep track of. A lot of people in my area have stopped studying because it cannot be done this way. I myself have also decided to only follow small courses so that I have the rest of the week to recover.
